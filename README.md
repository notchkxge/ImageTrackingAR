1. Image Recognition: Implemented image tracking to detect and recognize specific images in real time.
2. AR Display: Developed a virtual TV interface that appears when the target image is detected, with a video-start button.
3. Real-Time Object Tracking: Integrated real-time object tracking algorithms to accurately align virtual objects with real-world images.
3. Interactive UI: Designed an intuitive user interface with a button to start the video overlay when the target image is recognized.
